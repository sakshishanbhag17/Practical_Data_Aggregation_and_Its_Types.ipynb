# Practical_Data_Aggregation_and_Its_Types.ipynb
This project demonstrates **Data Aggregation in Data Mining** using Python and Pandas. It covers sum, mean, count, min–max, and multi-level aggregation. The project also implements **time aggregation** (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and **spatial aggregation** (region- and city-wise sales) using synthetic sales data for analysis.
